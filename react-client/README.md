# Explanation of Benefits from Flexpa

This is a simple one page app that goes through a similar proccess that the `quickstart` repo goes through.

1. Authenticate. Simply click on the authenticate button and use one of the test users that includes Explanation of Benefits. In my trials, not all of them worked, but Kaiser Permanente did work.

2. After confirming it worked, you will get a vertical list of cards. Each card contains some vital information from an Explanation of Benefit, and allows you to expand the full details, as the record is quite big, and needs its own space. I run this on Chrome. 

3. I have been having issues with CORS errors. The page would load properly

Working version of the app:
